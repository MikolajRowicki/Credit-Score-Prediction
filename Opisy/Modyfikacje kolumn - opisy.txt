    Financial Stability Score: A combined score based on INCOME, WORK_SENIORITY, and BUSINESS AGE, which might represent the overall financial stability of an individual.

    Dependent Financial Burden: A feature reflecting the potential financial burden associated with dependents, calculated as the product of NO_OF_DEPENDENTS and AGE.

    Income to Seniority Ratio: This ratio of INCOME to WORK_SENIORITY (plus 1 to avoid division by zero) could indicate how well an individual is compensated relative to their experience.

    Client Loyalty Score: Calculated as the product of LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT and AGE, this score might reflect the loyalty and trust a client has in the business.

    Income Growth Potential: A feature combining INCOME, WORK_SENIORITY, and AGE in a way that might indicate potential for income growth. For example, a lower ratio of INCOME to WORK_SENIORITY and AGE might suggest higher growth potential, assuming younger individuals with less seniority might see more significant income increases over time.

    Stability Score: A composite score that could factor in WORK_SENIORITY, BUSINESS AGE, and LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT. This score could be a sum or product of these features, adjusted by coefficients to balance their influence. It might reflect an overall stability factor, considering job stability, business establishment, and client loyalty.

    Client Engagement Level: This could be an interaction term between LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT and the frequency or volume of transactions (if such data is available). It would give an idea of how actively engaged the client is.

    Age-Adjusted Income Level: Adjusting INCOME by AGE, perhaps through division or a more complex function, could help normalize income levels by age, reflecting how well someone is doing financially for their age group.

    Loyalty-Income Ratio: This feature could divide the LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT by INCOME, potentially highlighting if longer relationships correlate with higher or lower income levels, possibly indicating if more affluent clients tend to stay longer with the bank or not.

    Seniority-Loyalty Interaction: Multiplying WORK_SENIORITY by LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT might show a combined effect of job stability and bank loyalty, suggesting that individuals stable in their careers might also maintain longer relationships with the bank.

    Age-Adjusted Loyalty: Dividing LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT by AGE could provide insights into how quickly clients commit to a long-term relationship with the bank relative to their age, potentially identifying if younger or older clients are more likely to be loyal over a significant portion of their lifetime.

    Loyalty and Dependents: Multiplying LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT by NO_OF_DEPENDENTS could indicate if clients with more dependents tend to maintain longer relationships with the bank, possibly due to more complex financial needs or a greater appreciation for stability.

    Business Age and Client Loyalty Correlation: This feature could combine BUSINESS AGE with LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT, possibly through multiplication or division, to explore if longer-established businesses tend to retain clients for longer periods.

    Financial Stability and Loyalty Index: A composite score that includes INCOME, WORK_SENIORITY, BUSINESS AGE, and LENGTH_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_CLIENT, possibly as a weighted sum, to reflect an overall stability and loyalty perspective.
